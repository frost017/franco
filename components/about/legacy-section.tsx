            Frank Capasso & Sons was founded in 1970 by Francesco Capasso, built
            on a commitment to skilled craftsmanship, accountability, and pride
            in the work. From the beginning, the company focused on masonry and
            concrete work where precision and experience matter most.

            Over the decades, FCS evolved into a trusted restoration firm serving
            commercial, institutional, residential, and public clients
            throughout Connecticut and the surrounding region. The company&apos;s
            work has consistently centered on restoring, stabilizing, and
            extending the life of existing structures—often in occupied, aging,
            or sensitive environments.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, the company is led by Francesco Capasso&apos;s two sons, who
            continue to guide the firm with the same standards and values that
            shaped it from the start, while strengthening its capabilities for
            modern restoration challenges.
